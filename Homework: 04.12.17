A) create a new project in github called: aunt_Mary's_cake_of_permissions:
1.a.create a script that will scan whole os and will count amount of files that belongs to your user.
1.b add to prvious script validation - only user with your ID can run script all the others should be denied.
1.c. another feature to add the script: count also all hidden files in whole file system.
2.a create a script that will run every time you use "chmod commend": the script needs to be invoked as alias.
2.b. script should ask you if you are sure you would like to make these changes/
2.c. after "chmod" command finishes to run, user should see the summary of what was done: the name of the file that had permissions changed, date of the change and user who changed it. - it also needs to be inserted as an alias.
(to set an alias edit one of the bashrc files and the source the file.)
3.a.create a script that will receive a list of users. name of group  and list of aliases that they need and then will  created them.
3.b if the script will be run with other user than root, it should be notified to user and also kept in a log file that should be created in "/tmp" folder under a name of the script with ".log" suffix 
(for example: script_name.log)
4. create script that will recieve a list of folder names and with the same single command : it will create those folders and also will give them permissions of 555.
5.a create a script that will ask you to which groups you would like to be added
5.b in case you already are in the group it should be discarded and you need to be notified.
5.c in case you are not in the group, it should be anounced in green color with black background that you are going to be part of the group.
5.d amount of groups provided to script should be at least 4.
5.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!use functions to write this task
