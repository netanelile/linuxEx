* using "ssh-keygen" create a certficate on both of the machines.

ssh-keygen -t rsa

* copy public cert from one machine to other using "ssh-id-copy".

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pub nati-deb@192.***.*.*** #(wont add the user and host here cuz its public)

* copy cert from second machine without using "ssh-id-copy"

# at machine 1:
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa_pub
# maualy coppy the key
# at machine 2:
vim /.ssh/authorized_keys
# past there the copied key

* try connecting between machines to verify the connection.

ssh nati-cent@192.***.*.*** 

* creat another certficates without password-less certificate and copy it to all machines.

ssh keygen -t rsa
second
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/second.pub nati-deb@192.***.*.***
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/second.pub nati-cent@192.***.*.***

* on machine one, change ssh server port to 32225.

vim ssh_config
# change Port 22 to 32225

* on machine two, enable root login on machine.

vim sshd_config
# change PermitRootLogin to yes 

* on machine two,  create a script that prints you details: name, lastname, address, id, credit card number.

vim script
#! /bin/bash

echo Name     : Netanel
echo Last Name: Sananes
echo Address  : Never Land
echo Id       : 1234567890
echo Credit   : 0987654321


* run the script from machine two, on machine one.

################################################

* copy the script from machine two, to machine one.

scp script 192.168.*.***:/home


* enable ssh file transfer protocol (sftp) on both of the machines and test them.

# At the sshd_config file:
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server


* enable graphics forwarding via machine two.

# At the sshd_config file:
X11Forwarding yes

* on machine two, install vnc-server(tigervnc-server). 
  add vnc password by issuing "vncpasswd" command, and then  create vnc instance by running:
vncserver :1 -geometry 800x600 -depth 24 

apt-get install tightvncserver
vncpasswd
#type password and verify it

vncserver :1 -geometry 800x600 -depth 24

* use netstat command to verify that port 5901 is active.

netstat -plnt | grep 5901

* use ssh port redirecting to redirect port 5901 to port 8081.
##############################
ssh –L 5901:192.168.*.***:8081
ssh –L 5901:smtpserver:8081

* try to connect to port 8081 using vnc client.
